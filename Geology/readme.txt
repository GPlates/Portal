Hi both,

This one is MUCH better as it has some data over Antarctica and Greenland as well.  The only tiny problem will be that their ocean floor isochrons will not agree with our static polygons and agegrid.

I think we should try to use this one (using the ARESP static polygons, rotations and agegrid) and see whether it works ok.

Cheers,
Dietmar

Here is another map - probably better. I finally got it to work - I left it to load in ArcGIS in the background over the morning. 

I don't have a nice legend for it, but you can see the screenshots (not sure that it's OK to upload those to the portal), but you can direct people to:

Hi Michael,

Please use the static polygons and rotations from here:

http://www.earthbyte.org/ocean-basin-evolution-and-global-scale-plate-reorganization-events-since-pangea-breakup/

The globes could be called:

Geology reconstruction (for the reconstruction globe)

and

Continental Geology (for the present-day globe where the geology is draped over etopo1)

Cheers,
Dietmar

Hi Michael,

I’d like to have a globe made where continental geology (as per the file Sabin sent) is reconstructed the same way we reconstruct the gravity and magnetic grids (except for this one is easier because there are no data in the oceans). It would also be nice to have a second globe (just present-day) where the geology is draped over etopo1.  These would be nice additions to the portal, and likely not difficult to generate.

Michael, could you work on this (medium priority)?
